"""
The daemon responsible for changing the volume in response to a turn or press
of the volume knob.

The volume knob is a rotary encoder. It turns infinitely in either direction.
Turning it to the right will increase the volume; turning it to the left will
decrease the volume. The knob can also be pressed like a button in order to
turn muting on or off.

The knob uses two GPIO pins and we need some extra logic to decode it. The
button we can just treat like an ordinary button. Rather than poll
constantly, we use threads and interrupts to listen on all three pins in one
script.
